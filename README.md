# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects from Kaggle completed by me for competition, self learning, and hobby purposes. All in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

## Contents

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

	- [New York Housing Market Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ilya2raev/new-york-housing-market-analysis): EDA with the use of pandas, Folium, and visualization frameworks.
	- [World University Ranking Factors](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ilya2raev/university-rankings-eda): EDA and cleaning of university rankings dataset across the globe.
	- [IPL Auction EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ilya2raev/ipl-auction-eda): Analyzing a players' auction dataset about the most popular cricket Indian Premier League.
	- [Gross Average Monthly Wages by Country in 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ilya2raev/gross-average-monthly-wages-by-country-in-2020): Small EDA of monthly wages in the world.
	- [ATP Tennis EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ilya2raev/atp-tennis):  EDA of ATP tennis matches since 2000.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, numpy, folium_

- ### Natural Language Processing

	- [Disaster Tweets Classifier](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ilya2raev/nlp-with-disaster-tweets-tf-idf-bl-bert): Binary classification of disaster tweets. Consists of TF-IDF+LogReg baseline and BERT finetuning.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, pandas, nltk, tensorflow_

- ### Machine Learning
  
  - [Apples Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ilya2raev/testing-out-linear-models-on-apples-quality): Comparison of linear models on apples quality dataset, very likely synthesized due to suspicious data distribution and uninterpreted physical meaning.
  - [Titanic EDA & Training](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ilya2raev/titanic-with-knn-top-7): Can hardly say it is traning, because it is kNN, after all. But it produces solid results at the Kaggle competition.
  - [Adult Income EDA & CatBoost](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ilya2raev/adult-income-eda-catboost): Binary classification (<=50K, >50K) of adult income using CatBoost.
  - [Cars EDA & Training](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ilya2raev/cars-eda-training): Testing out different regularization techniques to predict mpg consumption.
		
	_Tools: pandas, scikit-learn, *boost, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy_
